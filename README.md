# LodgeManagementSystem

The lodge Management System we are going to implement will be covering all the basic
processes done in the lodge. It would handle Guest details, Reservation details,
Inventory management details, Room service details, staff management details and
room types. All the above mentioned details and information are stored in the system
database. It could save time when retrieving data from the database. Interfaces will be
designed user friendly and the ﬁinctions will be displayed in a simple manner. The
System we are going to develop will give remedies for the problems that are currently
facing by our client. Shifting to our system can acquire advantages such as saving of
time, man hours, and space wastage. This will increase the efﬁciency in hotel daily
activities.
